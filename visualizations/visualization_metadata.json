Can you share it with me and sew my shirt?\" Her mom smiled and said, \"Yes, Lily, we can share the needle and fix your shirt.\"\n\nTogether, they shared the needle and sewed the button on Lily's shirt. It was not difficult for them because they were sharing and helping each other. After they finished, Lily thanked her mom for sharing the needle and fixing her shirt.

The crab looked at Fin and said, \"No, I don't want to play. I am cold and I don't feel fine.\"\n\nFin felt sad but wanted to help the crab feel better. He swam away and thought of a plan. He remembered that the sun could make things warm. So, Fin swam to the top of the water and called to the sun, \"Please, sun, help my new friend feel fine and not freeze!\"\n\nThe sun heard Fin's call and shone its warm light on the shore. The crab started to feel better and not so cold. He saw Fin and said, \"Thank you, little fish, for making me feel fine. I don't feel like I will freeze now. Let's play together!\" And so, Fin and the crab played and became good friends.",

All the other trees were big and strong, but the cherry tree was small and weak. The cherry tree was envious of the big trees.\n\nOne day, the cherry tree felt a tickle in its branches. It was a little spring wind. The wind told the cherry tree not to be sad. The wind said, \"You are special because you have sweet cherries that everyone loves.\" The cherry tree started to feel a little better.\n\nAs time went on, the cherry tree grew more and more cherries. All the animals in the land came to eat the cherries and play under the cherry tree. The cherry tree was happy because it had many friends now. The cherry tree learned that being different can be a good thing. And they all lived happily ever after.",
