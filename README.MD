## Subject model choice
I went for `deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b` because it:
- fits easily into my RTX 4090 (about 4.7GB in VRAM)
- is small enough to be feature-mapped by a single individual
- is large enough to incorporate interesting properties and meaningful, abstract features
- exhibits extremely strong censorship & disinformation patterns
