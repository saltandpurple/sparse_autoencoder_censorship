## Subject model choice
I went for `Qwen3-8B` because it:
- fits easily into my RTX 4090 (about 8GB + cache/context in VRAM)
- is small enough to be feature-mapped by a single individual
- is large enough to incorporate interesting properties and meaningful, abstract features
- exhibits extremely strong censorship & disinformation patterns
- is supported by TransformerLens which makes activation capture more straightforward (as opposed to DeepSeek R1)
